[Google Hangout-on-Air](https://plus.google.com/events/cdfm6n7tl8fv7rnmhbm7kfba818)

We'll learn how to create a simple map view using the Google Maps API to capture a user's geographical location as a useful input for our app. We'll use this to geographically tag our images and sounds from earlier with a physical location.

[Google Hangout-on-Air](https://plus.google.com/events/c634o8lua297u9fgmdkv0tng3q8)

We'll learn how to use the new MapBox API, an alternative to Google Maps that uses the open source OpenStreetMaps, and we'll save geographical markers to offline storage on our mobile device. This is useful for data that we want available even when we lose cell phone reception or wifi connectivity.
